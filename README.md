# Balinese Cat
A naturally curious and perceptive species, the Balinese are modeled after real world cats built for agility, silence, and survival. While not particularly strong, their reflexes, senses, and movement give them a natural edge in exploration and evasion.

## Abilities

<ins>Silent Step</ins> <br>
Your padded feet allow them to move undetected, avoiding both prey and predators. <br>
_You cannot trigger sculk sensors, and hostile mobs are less able to detect you._

<ins>Leap</ins> <br>
Balinese cats excel in powerful, targeted leaps both in play and in flight. <br>
_Activate to leap forward and upward. You take no fall damage from this leap, and gain a short burst of Speed III after landing._

<ins>Keen Awarness</ins> <br>
Felines process motion and threat faster than most species. <br>
_After being hit, gain a burst of Speed I for five seconds, with a thirty second cooldown._

<ins>Righting Reflex</ins> <br>
Cats possess a natural ability to reorient midair and avoid injury when falling. <br>
_You take 50% reduced fall damage, and are immune to falls shorter than 6 blocks. After falling, you get a short dash of Speed I, mimicking an escape response._

<ins>Night Vision</ins> <br>
You have permanent Night Vision and can see clearly in caves, nighttime forests, and shadows.

<ins>Hydrophobic</ins> <br>
Despite your agility, water happens to disrupt a cat's balance and coordination. <br>
_While fully submerged, you suffer Slowness II and Mining Fatigue I, and take minor damage over time. Rain doesnâ€™t hurt you, but does interrupts your comfort by slowing down your movement and actions._

<ins>Pescetarian Preference</ins> <br>
As a cat, you **love** fish. You find they fill you up more.

<ins>Light Frame</ins> <br>
Your build prioritizes mobility over durability.
_You have 8 hearts (16 HP), are just over half the size of a human, and take slightly more knockback from attacks. Having a coat of fur, you also take significantly more fire damage._

<ins>Catlike Appearance</ins> <br>
Creepers are scared of you and will only exxplode if you attack them first.
